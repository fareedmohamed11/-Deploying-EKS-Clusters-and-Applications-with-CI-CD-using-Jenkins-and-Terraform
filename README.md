# Streamlining EKS Deployment and CI/CD: A Step-by-Step Guide to Automating Application Delivery with Jenkins and Terraform

Welcome to this step-by-step guide on deploying an EKS cluster and application with complete CI/CD!

In this guide, we’ll streamline your application delivery process by automating your infrastructure deployment. You’ll learn how to set up a fully functional EKS cluster and a simple containerized application and run it with a CI/CD pipeline that automates the entire process from code to production.

Let’s get started and explore the world of EKS, CI/CD, and automation!

## What We’ll Build
We are going to build and deploy a lot of things. Here is the outline for our project:

1. Setting up Jenkins Server with Terraform
2. Installing necessary tools: Java, Jenkins, AWS CLI, Terraform CLI, Docker, Sonar, Helm, Trivy, Kubectl.
3. Configuring Jenkins server.
